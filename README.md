# CraftMate

CraftMate is a Minecraft crafting tool created for a school project. I've decided to share it so that people may use it if they feel like it. Currently there are a few updates in the pipeline for improvement but if you have any ideas feel free to make a PR and I will review it. 

## Web Demo

If you would like to see a [demo](http://steveacalabro.github.io/CraftMate) or just use the application head over to [http://steveacalabro.github.io/CraftMate](http://steveacalabro.github.io/CraftMate)


## Devlopment

This section covers some information you will need to devlop.

### Setup

Run both `npm install` and `bower install` when you clone the repository.

### Building/starting the app

Run `grunt` for building. This will also start a live reload server so you can test on the fly

### Electron

I have included electron.io which allows the application to deployed to desktops in this project, but I have not speant much time getting it production ready. I was more or less playing around with some new things. If you want more information on it create an issue and I will take a look at it.
